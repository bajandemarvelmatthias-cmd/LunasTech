## AI RULES — READ FULLY BEFORE ANY ACTION
---

1. Read this entire file before proposing any structure, modifying
   any file, or debugging anything.
2. Project scale drives everything. Read the Scale field first.
   Do not propose a structure that exceeds what the scale requires.
3. Before touching any file → identify all files connected to it.
   This map is your reference. If a connection is not listed here,
   find it before proceeding — do not assume it is isolated.
4. If the structure evolves during the build → update this file.
   An outdated map is worse than no map.
5. Never create folders or layers that the current scale does not
   justify. Do not over-architect small projects. Do not under-
   structure large ones.

## SCALE — READ THIS FIRST
---

**Project Scale:**
[ ] Small — single purpose, few screens, one developer
[x] Medium — multiple features, growing complexity, needs modularity
[ ] Large — multi-module, many contributors, long-term maintenance

**Scale Guidelines the AI must follow:**

Small → near-flat structure. Minimal subfolders. Group only what
        genuinely needs grouping. No layers for their own sake.

Medium → feature-based grouping. Each feature owns its files.
         Shared utilities in one place. Clear separation of concerns
         without over-engineering.

Large → fully modular. Domain-driven. Each module is independently
        navigable. Explicit dependency boundaries. Documented entry
        points for every major section.

## PROJECT REFERENCE
---

**Project Type:**
Progressive web app (installable, offline-capable) with a separate API backend

**Tech Stack:**
List each layer with the specific technology and version:
- Frontend: Vite + React + TypeScript, shadcn components, Phosphor icons, vite-plugin-pwa (versions to be pinned at setup)
- Backend: Node + TypeScript (web framework not yet chosen)
- Database: PostgreSQL (hosting provider not yet chosen)
- Auth: login and signup required; approach not yet decided
- Other: see decision-log.md #1

**Entry Points:**
Pending approval of the folder structure.

**Folder Structure:**
Paste or describe the current structure here.
AI: if this is empty at project start → propose a structure based
on the Scale field above, explain each folder's purpose, and wait
for human approval before creating anything.

**Module / Feature Map:**
List the main modules or features and what each one is responsible for.
- Module/Feature:  → Responsible for:
- Module/Feature:  → Responsible for:

**Key Dependencies Between Files:**
Which files depend on which? What breaks if X changes?
(This is the map the AI uses before touching anything)
- [file/module] → depends on → [file/module]
- [file/module] → depends on → [file/module]

**What Must Never Be Touched Without Human Approval:**
(e.g. auth logic, payment flows, database schema, config files)

**Known Fragile Areas:**
Areas of the codebase that have caused bugs before or require
extra care when modified.

## STRUCTURE CHANGE LOG
---
AI: when the structure changes during the build, log it here.

| Date | Change | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
